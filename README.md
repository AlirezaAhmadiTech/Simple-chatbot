### 📌 Notes

- You can teach the bot new responses during the conversation.
- To provide multiple responses for the same input, separate them with a hyphen `-`. For example:
      hi-hello-hey
  
The bot will choose one randomly each time you use that input.
- The bot saves all learned responses in a file named `responses.json`.
- ✅ Your responses will be saved even after you close the program 😉
- Type `clean` to clear the screen, and `bye` to exit the chatbot.
